# AI Portfolio – Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my **AI & Machine Learning Portfolio**, containing projects completed as part of a structured roadmap.  
This repository showcases my **skills in regression, classification, and unsupervised learning**, along with end-to-end workflows, data preprocessing, visualization, and model evaluation. All projects are **portfolio-ready** and documented in detail.
