# Week 4 – Kaggle & End-to-End Machine Learning

## Overview
This week focuses on applying machine learning to real-world datasets and building end-to-end ML workflows. The main goal is to take a project from raw data to actionable insights while practicing portfolio-ready documentation and submissions.

## Topics Covered
- Creating and exploring a Kaggle account
- Understanding Kaggle competitions (Titanic, House Prices)
- Loading, cleaning, and preprocessing datasets
- Feature engineering and model selection
- Training and evaluating machine learning models
- Documenting results and insights
- Preparing portfolio-ready notebooks

## Mini Projects
1. **Kaggle Titanic Competition**
   - Binary classification problem: Predict survival of passengers
   - Practice: EDA, preprocessing, modeling, leaderboard submission

2. **End-to-End ML Workflow Mini Project**
   - Full ML pipeline:
     - Load & clean data
     - Feature engineering
     - Model training
     - Evaluation & insights
   - Demonstrates real-world ML problem-solving skills

## Skills Gained
- Real-world machine learning workflow
- Working with Kaggle datasets and competitions
- Data preprocessing & feature engineering
- Model evaluation (accuracy, RMSE, F1-score)
- Portfolio documentation and presentation
